# Steps for Creating a New Lab

## Create Problems
For each problem...
1. Create problem directory (<problem number>_<problem name>) under lab_specification and run lab to create initial template.
2. Create problem solution code (<problem number>_<problem name>.py)
3. Create / modify problem tests if needed (tests/t#/[in, out, testFuncs.py])
4. Delete test output if it was created already and run tests to generate expected output and make sure they work.
3. Create problem description (instructions.md)
 
## Create Replit Tests
Delete or add tests in replit Tests window and make sure they work.
